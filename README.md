# MSI Afterburner Unlock Advanced Settings (Work only in 4.6.6 beta version)

These `MSIAfterburner.dat` and `MSIAfterburner.oem` files are the original but already decrypted files from MSI Afterburner 4.6.6 beta. This means you can edit more setting within them.

To use them, simply replace the original files located in `C:\Program Files (x86)\MSI Afterburner` with your modified versions. The program should then function normally.
